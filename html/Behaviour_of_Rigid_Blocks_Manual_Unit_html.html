<p align="justify">Start the experiment with the default values of length, mass and initial displacement (in angle). Pause the experiment after few cycles and note the observation. <br /><br /> <strong>Observation 1:</strong> Rocking behaviour of the rigid block to given displacement<br /><br /> Observe the rocking behaviour of the block and also the energy loss during each impact.<br /> User can note the zero crossings of the displacement and calculate the time period.<br /> User can also compare where the time period remains same under different amplitude conditions.</p>
