<p align="justify"><strong>Observation 1:</strong> Finding natural frequencies and mode shapes <br /><br /> 1. Take n storey structure. <br /> 2. Input mass and stiffness of each storey <br /> 3. Run the experiment. User can see eigen values (natural frequencies) and eigen vectors (mode shapes). <br /> 4. Use may note the eigen vectors and check for modal orthogonality. <br /><br /> <strong>Observation 2:</strong> Find the response of the structure to given ground motion. <br /><br /> 5. Take n storey structure. <br /> 6. Input mass and stiffness of each storey.<br /> 7. Select ground motion and also damping. <br /> 8. Run the experiment. User can find the response of the each floor level on the screen. User can also find the response of each mode.</p>
