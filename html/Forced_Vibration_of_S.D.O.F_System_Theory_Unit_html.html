<p align="justify">Forced vibration is of two types:<br /> 1. undamped forced vibration<br /> 2. damped forced vibration <br /> <strong>Undamped forced vibration :</strong> The differential governing equation for system without damping is m&uuml; + ku = posin&omega;t <br /> where, m = mass; &uuml; = acceleration; k = stiffness; u = displacement; &omega;n= natural frequency; po= amplitude of force. <br /> Solution of the given equation is <br /><img src="http://sd-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/exp3/Expr3.png" /></p>
