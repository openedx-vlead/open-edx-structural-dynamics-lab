<p align="justify"><strong>Observation 1:</strong> Effect of time period on maximum response<br /><br /> 1. Run the experiment with default ground motion and building parameters <br /> 2. Observe the response and note down the maximum response. <br /> 3. Repeat the experiment by changing the values of mass of the structure. (Note: Change in mass will change the time period of the structure) <br /> 4. Note the maximum response.<br /> 5. Plot the graph between the maximum response and the time period of the structure.<br /><br /> <strong>Observation 2:</strong> Effect of resonance without damping <br /><br /> 6. Select Resonance from the list of earthquakes. And set damping to Zero<br /> 7. Run the experiment and note the displacement.<br /> 8. Response value increases and reaches peak when forcing frequency is nearing natural frequency of the structure.<br /> 9. Draw the plot between maximum response and frequency ratio.</p>
