<p align="justify"><strong>Observation 1:</strong> Concept of response spectrum <br /> There are 3 buildings shown on the screen. User can select mass and stiffness of all 3 buildings. However, user need to make sure that at least two buildings time period is same.<br /> Select the earthquake ground motion record and also damping.<br /> Run the experiment.<br /> You will observe after completing that the maximum displacement of the oscillators with same time period is same irrespective of their different masses and stiffness's.</p>
