<p>Start the experiment with default values of mass and stiffness of SDOF for 'Step force' type. Total time for the experiment is 10 seconds and drop time is 4 seconds.<br /><br /> <strong>Stage 1: </strong><br /> In this stage, user can be allowed to change the type of force and force value along with damping value. Observe the response of SDOF with different types of forces.<br /><br /> <strong>Stage 2: </strong><br /> User can change all the dimensions related to mass and stiffness of SDOF along with force type and damping values. Observe the response of SDOF by changing all the parameters. <br /><br /><a>Manual view on Impulse Response of S.D.O.F system is under construction</a></p>
