<p align="justify">Where, &tau; = Torque ; I = Moment of Inertia; &alpha; = Angular Velocity. m is mass of the oscillator, l is the length of the oscillator and theta is initial displacement. The above equation can be rearranged as -</p>

<p align="justify">If the amplitude of angular displacement is small then we can use the approximation (sin&theta; &asymp; &theta;). By considering the above approximation, the equation of motion reduces to :</p>
