<p>Vibration control is a set of technical means aimed to mitigate seismic impacts in building and non-building structures. <br /><br /> All seismic vibration control devices may be classified as passive and active where: <br /><br /> 1. Passive control device (TMD, Base Isolator) imparts forces that are developed directly as a result of motion of structure (i.e., no actuator involved). <br /> 2. Active control devices incorporate real-time recoding instrumentation on the ground integrated with earthquake input processing equipment and actuators within the structure. <br /><br /> <img src="http://sd-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/exp10/03.jpg" style="width: 80%; height: 80%;" /></p>
